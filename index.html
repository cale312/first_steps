                <p>The Time Ball Tower, built in 1894,<br/> was an important navigational aid for ships during the 19th century.<br/> Its primary purpose was to relay the correct time to the ships in the<br/> harbour and bay by dropping the big red ball on its roof down a metal spike.<br/> The ships’ masters could determine the rate and error of their chronometers<br/> only by having the correct time. </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>The Time Ball on this tower situated on top of Portswood Ridge was invented<br/> by Captain Robert Wauchope and built in 1894. Its function was to relay the time<br/> to ships in the harbour. This was done by simply dropping the ball along<br/> the shaft at a given time indicated by the Cape Royal Observatory,<br/> so that the ships’ masters could determine accurate time for effective navigation.<br/> It remained in use for 40 years, until new technology took over.<br/> It then lay idle for 63 years before being restored and officially recommissioned in November 1997.</p>

                <p>During WWII, over 300 ships were repaired here;<br/> today the Robinson Dry Dock is one of the few of its age still in operation in the world.<br/> The Pump House next to it housed the machinery to pump out the water.<br/> (This building was the location of the Planet Hollywood Restaurant in the late ‘90s and<br/> was the scene of the infamous 1998 bombing which injured 25 people and resulted in one death.<br/> This was one of a number of bombings that rocked Cape Town during a turbulent<br/> time involving gangs and extremists.) In the early 1900s, apart from normal business activities,<br/> swimming galas and rowing regattas took place in the dock. </p></div>

It also contained all the instruments that the<br/> Port Captain needed such as a clock for ships to see the correct time, signal flags,<br/> Morse lamps and a telescope.<hr/> Within the three-storey, single-room-per-floor building, there was a snug reading room<br/> for ships’ masters; the second room was the mess and the last was a room made up of mirrors<br/> on all the walls so ships could be seen from every angle.<br/> The Clock Tower was also known as the Dock Clock or Tide Gauge Tower;<br/> its original colour was white.<hr/>
                During the Anglo-Boer War, the Tower became the headquarters of Admiral Chichester,<br/> and his staff and the Royal Navy occupied it again during WWI.<br/> One of the greatest sights from this tower must have been the 128 ships seen in the<br/> harbour and bay one day in 1901; not eve<p></div>
